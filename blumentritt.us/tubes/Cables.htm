<p style="font-family:verdana;color:SaddleBrown;font-size:14px;"><strong>Texas Tone&#8482; Speaker Cables</strong><br/>
<br/>
<a name="#speaker"></a>Texas Tone&#8482; combo amp speaker cables are proudly made by hand in Austin, Texas, the same as all Blumentritt Amplification products.</br>
<br/>
I build my own speaker cables for my combo amps using USA-made Switchcraft plugs and heavy gauge (18AWG) hand twisted pair wire.  This ensures years of noise and trouble-free operation.<br/>
<br/>
For tweed style combo amps with rear mounted chassis and controls, I use a heavy duty straight Switchcraft 1/4" plug.  For combo amps with top mounted chassis and front mounted controls, a right-angle heavy duty Switchcraft plug fills the bill.  I solder and test all the connections by hand.<br/>
<br/>18" Texas Tone&#8482; speaker cable: <strong>$12.00</strong></br>

<a name="#"></a><p style="font-family:verdana;color:SaddleBrown;font-size:14px;"><strong>Texas Tone&#8482; Guitar Cords</strong><br/>
<br/>
Texas Tone&#8482; guitar cords are proudly made by hand in Austin, Texas, the same as all Blumentritt Amplification products, using only high quality Switchcraft plugs and Mogami cable, found worldwide in the best recording studios.</br>
<br/>

This cable was designed for excellent sound in a durable package. Its high purity copper shielding ensures very low noise, while the high purity copper center conductor conveys ultimate tone. The cross-linked polyethylene dielectric is heat resistant and will not shrink as quickly as PVC. The cable is also designed to prevent microphonics with a conductive carbon impregnated polymer sub-shield placed under the shield conductor. If you want the best cable to go from your instrument to your rig, then this is it.<br/>
<br/>
Stocked in 10' and 12' lengths with one straight and one right-angle USA-made Switchcraft plugs.  Other lengths and configurations available upon request.<br/>
