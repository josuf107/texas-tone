									<!--best amp ever quotes-->
																		<h3>"Best Amp Ever!"</h3>
									<p><strong>"This is the best amp I've ever played</strong>. I was skeptical how just 4 tubes was gonna give a good Fender-ish blues tone. It's awesome. So warm and articulate. I actually moved up to a thicker pick and really started digging in and it only got better." - <i>Mike W., Ohio, describing his <a href="http://austintubeamps.com/Amps15.html" target="_blank">Texas Tone 1540</a> amp.</i></p>

									<p><strong>"Amazing!!! </strong>I feel like I’ve finally made it. Bruce, you’re a dang genius!!!

									<p><strong>"Your Texas Tone [12] sounds great! </strong>I think it is an excellent amp for smaller room gigs or rehearsal, and definitely studio work. It is really responsive, breaks up nicely, and gives a great warm/slightly-compressed overdrive. And man, that tremolo sounds sweet!  There were a couple of those ballads where Schley and I both heard it and gave the thumbs-up! I wouldn't change a thing about it. Thanks for letting me play through it!" - <i>John Winsor</i>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rosieandtheramblers/" target="_blank">Rosie and The Ramblers</a>.</p>

									<!--Distinctly Different amps-->

									<h3>"Distinctly Different"</h3>
									<p>Many times I&#39;ll play amps and you can&#39;t tell one from the other. <strong>These are very distinctly different sounding amps</strong>. They made me play differently. I started approaching the instrument in a different way as I played each one." - <i>Mark Daven, </i><a href="https://youtu.be/d4uBhDkRwOI?si=tkOnnVVtvBiPnL7I" target="_blank">Guitar Radio Show</a></p>

									<p><q>"The &#39;Texas Tone 12&#39; amp from Blumentritt Amplification [has] the crisp cleans, and crunchy punch and pop I&#39;m always looking for... <strong>it is definitely the sound of Austin, Texas, right there</strong>".</q> - <i>Mark Daven, </i><a href="http://guitarradioshow.com/?s=144" target="new">Guitar Radio Show</a></p>
									<p><strong>"At last !!!</strong>, been playing with this for a couple of weeks and am really impressed !, made by [Bruce] Blumentritt in Austin it's a 12AU7 pre amp that has controls that work - yippee :-) It doesn't sound like a Marshall pushed to '11' just warm fat and very musical.  Warm sustain/hardly know its on type of thing, reckon this'll be a keeper." - <i>John Stannard</i>, guitarist. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100077122849459" target="_blank"> John Stannard fan site.</a></p>
